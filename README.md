# The Web Application <br>
Sometimes we feel what we deserve - sometimes not. <br> RÖMUH helps you to embrace how you feel here and now: in this moment. The purpose isn't to make you happy, here all moods are valued and it's important to be in different states. In other words.. if you're angry you should be allowed to be angry, if you're happy you should be allowed to be happy. <br>
By selecting which mood that you are currently feeling you will get food- and movie recomendations based on your mood. The movie section is controlled by an api that fetch three diffrent movies based on one genre. <br>
